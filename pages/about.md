## Introduction

In the times of social distancing, many mathematical activities are moving online, and it is now possible to choose seminars not on the basis of location, but on the basis of interests. Forseeing that mathematical activities will continue to move online, and thus become accessible to a wider audience, we decided to create this website as a resource to facilitate these changes.

The website is designed with the idea to keep it simple and easily extendable. The ways it will be extended depend on you, so please send us your suggestions.

Please send any bug reports and technical requests to *anton dot mellit at univie dot ac dot at*.

## Markdown
Information about seminars can be entered using Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax>. This is a language that combines
simple text with markup functionalities. Simple text can be entered as is. Line breaks are ignored and paragraphs are separated using empty lines. Some of the most common markups are:

### Headers
```
# Main title
## Subtitle
### Subsubtitle
```

### Fonts
```
*italic*
**bold**
```
become *italic*, **bold**

### Links
```
<https://simple.link>
[click here](https://simple.link)
```
become <https://simple.link>, [click here](https://simple.link).

### Code or filenames
~~~
```
print 'Hello World'
```
~~~
and 
```
`output.txt`
```
become

```
print 'Hello World'
```

and `output.txt`. Watch out, these signs are backticks, not quotes!

### Lists

```      
 * item 1
 * item 2
```
become 

 * item 1
 * item 2

### Latex
```
$$
2+2=4
$$
```
and 
```
$2+2=4$
```
become 
$$
2+2=4
$$
and $2+2=4$.
